1. **Eliminates Chaos:** Replaces unstructured file-sharing with organized, department-specific content.
2. **Reduces Complaints:** Staff no longer need to raise tickets for missing resources or unclear training steps.
3. **Speeds Up Onboarding:** New hires can get up to speed quickly with clearly presented videos and documents.
4. **Empowers Teams:** Admins can upload and manage content without technical help.
